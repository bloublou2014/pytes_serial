As of 0.5.0 logging and cells monitoring were introduced.

In order to facilitate these, two new sections were introduced in pytes_serial.cfg, [logging] and [events].

Please use and reconfigure the new pytes_serial.cfg version or copy / paste these two sections in your existing config file.
Without these, program will not work.

[logging] - give you the possibility to select level of logging from DEBUG to ERROR. According python documentaion the criticality is in this order: DEBUG > INFO > WARNING > ERROR. So, selecting logging.INFO will show all logs with INFO > WARNING > ERROR

Theare are two log files:
pytes_serial.log - here script events are logged
battery_events.log - here cells details are logged
The size of the logs and the numbers of backups is configurable.

[events] - this section give you the posibility to activate /dezactivate new feature of cells monitoring. Here there are some others parameters like numbers os cells or level of monitoring details from INFO to WARNING. 

Events are generated and reported by BMS (pylon,pytes) and can be i.e HV - high voltage, LV - low voltage or daily events such idle, charge or discharge.

Events were clasified in these two categories, based on degree of criticability (personal experience) without any validation from pylon and pytes manufacturer (they simply refused to provide me additional documentation).

For example the daily / normal ones are INFO and the rest are WARNING.

How this works:

There are 3 types of events that are reported under "PWR" command: power_events, bat_events and sys_faults.
Usualy they are zero. Once one event occur an event number is reported.

If the events_monitoring = true on each event diffent than zero battery details are logged.
If the events_monitoring = true and cells_details = true, on each event diffent than zero cells details are logged on top.

JSON file update:
If the events_monitoring = true, total number of events  power, bat, sys are counted and reported in JSON file for further use in automation.
