config file sections explained

[logging]
Give you the possibility to select level of logging from DEBUG to ERROR. 
According python documentation the criticality is in this order: DEBUG > INFO > WARNING > ERROR. 
Selecting logging.INFO will show all logs with INFO and so on.

Two logs files are created:
pytes_serial.log   -- here script events are logged
battery_events.log -- here event monitoring are logged
The size of the logs and the numbers of backups is configurable too.

[events_monitoring] 
This section give you the possibility to activate / deactivate / configure 'events monitoring' feature. 
There are 3 types of events that are reported after "PWR" command: power_events, bat_events and sys_faults.
Usualy they are zero. Once one event occur an event number is reported.
Events are generated and reported by BMS (pylon, pytes) and can be normal events [i.e IDLE, CHARGE, DISCHARGE] or important one [i.e HV - high voltage, LV - low voltage].
I classified all these events in two categories, based on degree of criticability (personal experience) without any validation from pylon and pytes manufacturer (they simply refused to provide me additional documentation).
For example the daily / normal ones are INFO and the rest are WARNING.

if events_monitoring = true -- on each event different than zero battery details are logged with monitoring_level criteria
if events_monitoring = true and cells_details = true --on each event different than zero cells details are logged, with monitoring_level criteria, on top of battery details.
if monitoring_level  = INFO    --will log all events includes the normal one (usually used for debug purpose)
if monitoring_level  = WARNING --will log only the important one


[cells_monitoring]
This section give you the possibility to activate / deactivate / configure 'cells monitoring' feature.
The big difference between 'cells monitoring' and 'events monitoring' is that in 'cells monitoring' the cell parameters are continuously monitored while
in 'events monitoring' they are recorded ONLY when an event occurs.

if cells_monitoring = true -- cells monitoring is activated, sensors will be created for cells parameters in Home Assistant and cells with be monitored with defined frequency.
if cells_monitoring = true and monitoring_level = low  --sensors only for 'voltage' will be created
if cells_monitoring = true and monitoring_level = medium --sensors for 'voltage', temperature, voltage_status and statistics will be created
if cells_monitoring = true and monitoring_level = high --sensors for all parameters will be created [attention with high amount of data send, recorded]
